# Make CSV Files
This repo contains an example of a script that generates an electrode csv file for a Neuropixels probe aligned with the central column of the BBP somatosensory cortex model. To run this example, first run *launch.sh* in the *../SSCx/data/simulation* folder. Then, run *WriteNPCSV.sh*
